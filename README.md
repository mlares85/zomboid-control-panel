<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧩 Mod Manager
Tracks every Workshop mod on your server and flags updates through the Steam API. Import a Steam collection and drive server membership from it — adding a mod writes `WorkshopItems=`, resolves its internal mod ID into `Mods=`, and picks up map folders on its own.

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ⚠️ Mod Conflicts & Load Order
Scans your mod list for known incompatibilities, missing dependencies, and load-order issues. Severity-tinted findings so you see real problems before you boot the server. Load order can auto-sort from each mod's declared `require=`, with a preview of every move before anything is written.

## Fork Enhancements

This fork extends the upstream panel with architectural improvements and new features:

### 📚 Built-in Help & Wiki
Every page has contextual help. Every field and option has a tooltip explaining what it does, why it matters, and whether beginners need to change it — with links to deeper wiki articles. 26 searchable articles covering setup, Docker, mods, templates, backups, scheduling, Discord, and advanced topics. No external docs site needed.

### 🔌 Server Provider Abstraction
Modular `FileAccess` interface replaces 200+ scattered `fs` calls with a clean abstraction. Two implementations ship today:
- **`LocalFiles`** — direct filesystem access for native, docker-local, and docker-managed servers
- **`SftpMirrorFiles`** — session-aware SFTP mirror with pull/edit/push semantics and a concurrency lock for remote servers

This is the foundation for platform-specific server providers (native SteamCMD on Windows/Linux, Docker via OrbStack on macOS).

### 🐳 Docker Managed Servers
Create and fully manage PZ server containers from the panel UI. Shared base volume (~3 GB of game files downloaded once), per-server data volumes, auto port assignment, internal Docker network for RCON, container lifecycle events via Socket.IO, and resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network).

### 🧪 Comprehensive E2E Testing
Two-tier Playwright test suite:
- **UI smoke tests** (`npm run test:e2e`) — 89 tests across all 16 pages, no Docker needed
- **Integration tests** (`npm run test:e2e:integration`) — full workflow tests with a live PZ server in Docker (server lifecycle, RCON console, backup create/restore, template save/export, settings persistence)

Plus 830+ unit tests (723 server + 107 client).

### 🏗️ Structural Improvements
- Dashboard decomposed from 1,556 → 131-line shell + 12 components
- Backups decomposed from 1,077 → 160-line shell + 7 components
- Per-server RCON status probing across all configured servers
- Container resource stats polling (CPU/memory/disk/network)
- Backup server snapshots with curated config data
- Mount auto-discovery with guided server creation
- Platform-specific onboarding (macOS Docker guidance, Windows firewall hints)

## What It Does

### Operate
- **Server control** — Start, stop, restart, save. Live status and uptime.
- **Console** — Live log viewer and RCON terminal with command history.
- **Scheduling** — Recurring restarts, saves, broadcasts with countdown warnings.
- **Backups** — Create, restore, and manage world backups.

### Observe
- **Players** — Online list, activity history, kick/ban/unban, access levels, notes and tags.
- **World map** — Live player positions on Knox County with right-click actions.
- **Mod manager** — Track Workshop mods and detect updates, decide server membership from your Steam collection, auto-sort load order by declared dependencies, and scan for conflicts. Collection sync adds what's missing without deleting the optional mods you keep on the side.
- **Server config** — Full INI editor with structured and raw views. Sandbox, spawn points, mod settings — searchable and editable in-browser.

### Extend
- **Events & weather** — Rain, storms, blizzards, climate control, time control, sound triggers, zombie management.
- **PanelBridge** — Server-side Lua mod for actions RCON can't reach: teleport, heal, god mode, character export/import, inventory.
- **Discord bot** — Slash commands and two-way chat relay.
- **Multi-server** — Manage multiple PZ servers from one panel.
- **Chunk cleaner** — Visual map selector for cleaning unused chunks.
- **Auto-update** — Checks for new releases, downloads and applies them.

---

## Requirements

- **Project Zomboid dedicated server** — Build 41 or Build 42. Tested through B42.18.
- **RCON enabled** in your server `.ini` (`RCONPort=27015` and `RCONPassword=...`).
- **Network access** between the panel and the PZ server (same machine, same LAN, or reachable IP).
- For PanelBridge features: `DoLuaChecksum=false` in the server `.ini`.

The packaged binary includes its own runtime — no Node.js, Python, or Java install needed on the panel host.

---

## Quick Start

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/fpsacha/zomboid-control-panel/releases/latest). Self-contained binary — no dependencies.

### Windows
1. Extract `ZomboidControlPanel-windows.zip`
2. Run `Start.bat`
3. Open `http://localhost:3001`

### Linux
```bash
tar xzf ZomboidControlPanel-linux.tar.gz
./start.sh
```
Works on Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, CentOS Stream 8+, Rocky 8+, or anything with glibc 2.28+.

### Docker

Download [docker-compose.install.yml](docker-compose.install.yml), then run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.install.yml up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3001`. This starts the panel with persistent Docker
volumes. For a panel that manages a PZ server on the same host, use the fully
documented [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and configure its bind mounts.
The Compose files use named volumes for panel state, so do not replace them with
host `./panel-data` or `./data` mounts unless those directories are owned by
UID/GID `1000:1000`.

#### Shared PZ folders: Docker permissions

When the panel bind-mounts Project Zomboid folders, set `PUID` and `PGID` in
`.env` to the numeric Linux user and group that own those folders:

```env
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
```

Find the values with `id -u` and `id -g`, then restart the panel:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`PUID` and `PGID` apply when the container starts as root, which is the default
for Docker and Docker Compose. If the runtime already pins a non-root user — for
example a Kubernetes pod with `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, and `runAsNonRoot: true`
— the entrypoint skips the ownership fix and the privilege drop and runs the
panel as the given user. In that case `PUID` and `PGID` are ignored, and the
`/app/data` and `/app/logs` volumes must already be writable by that UID/GID.

This works with the published image; rebuilding is not required. The panel
changes ownership only of its own `/app/data` and `/app/logs` directories,
never of PZ game or save mounts.

#### Separate PZ and panel containers

The panel can manage a PZ server in another container. Put both containers on
the same Docker network and set `RCON_HOST` to the PZ service name, not
`127.0.0.1`. For PanelBridge features, choose one of these file-access methods:

- Bind-mount the same PZ save directory into the panel and give both containers
  compatible numeric UID/GID access.
- In **Settings → PanelBridge**, enable **Remote server via SFTP**, enter the
  PZ host credentials and the absolute bridge folder, for example
  `/home/pz/Zomboid/Lua/panelbridge/MyServer`, then select **Test SFTP** and
  **Start SFTP bridge**.

Shared folders and SFTP enable configuration edits and PanelBridge actions.
They do not let the panel start or stop a separate Docker container. Keep PZ
lifecycle management in your container manager, unless you deliberately grant
the panel Docker socket access.

#### Unraid and Indifferent Broccoli

Use the panel-only image alongside an existing Indifferent Broccoli Project
Zomboid container. The two applications have separate persistent state: the
panel's own database and logs are **not** Project Zomboid's data or logs.

| Unraid host path | Panel container path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/mnt/user/appdata/zomboid-panel/data` | `/app/data` | Panel database, sessions, and backups |
| `/mnt/user/appdata/zomboid-panel/logs` | `/app/logs` | Panel logs |
| `/mnt/cache/appdata/projectzomboid/data` | `/pz-server` | PZ install; use the actual path from the PZ container's template |
| `/mnt/user/appdata/projectzomboid/config` | `/zomboid` | PZ server config, saves, logs, and PanelBridge files |

Do **not** use `/panel-data` or `/panel-logs`: the image never reads those
paths. The panel paths are exactly `/app/data` and `/app/logs`.

In Unraid's Docker page, add the four mappings above, set `PUID=99` and
`PGID=100` (or the owner shown by the PZ container), and use bridge networking.
Set `RCON_HOST` to the PZ container's name only when both containers share a
user-defined Docker network. Otherwise use the PZ container's fixed LAN IP or
host address and its exposed RCON port. Do not use `127.0.0.1`: inside the
panel it means the panel container itself.

After starting the panel, configure the container paths in the wizard or
Settings as `/pz-server` and `/zomboid`, never the `/mnt/...` host paths. For
PanelBridge, the shared `/zomboid` mount is enough. If your PZ container does
not expose that directory to the panel, use **Settings → PanelBridge → Remote
server via SFTP** instead.

The panel can monitor and administer the game through RCON, but it cannot
start, stop, or automatically update an independently managed Broccoli
container. Leave lifecycle and game updates with Unraid/Indifferent Broccoli;
the automatic server-update setting is for a PZ process managed by the panel.

A ready-to-import Unraid template is available at
[`docker/unraid/zomboid-panel.xml`](docker/unraid/zomboid-panel.xml). Edit the
two PZ host paths and RCON values before importing it.

#### Docker-managed servers (panel creates the containers)

If the panel has Docker socket access (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`),
use **Add Server → Docker Server** to let the panel create and fully manage PZ
server containers. The panel handles volumes, networking, port assignment, and
lifecycle — no manual `docker run` needed.

Two ways to provide game files:

- **Use existing files** — enter the path where PZ server files already live
  *as the panel container sees it* (e.g. `/pz-server`). The panel automatically
  resolves this to the host path for the bind mount.
- **Download** — the panel pulls a `steamcmd/steamcmd` image and downloads PZ
  server files (~7 GB) into a shared Docker volume. Subsequent servers reuse
  the same files.

Multiple managed servers share the same game binaries. Each server gets its own
Docker volume for config, saves, and mods. Ports are auto-assigned to avoid
conflicts. RCON traffic stays on an internal `zomboid-panel-net` bridge network.

Removing a managed server from the panel also stops and removes its container.

### Linux: installing a new PZ server through the panel

If you installed the panel as the bundled `zomboid-panel.service`, use this install folder in the setup wizard:

```text
/opt/zomboid-panel/data/pzserver
```

Create it once before opening the wizard:

```bash
sudo -u pzuser mkdir -p /opt/zomboid-panel/data/pzserver
```

The panel also creates `/opt/zomboid-panel/data/pzserver_Data` for server settings and save data. Leave **Custom config location** blank unless you have a specific reason to store it elsewhere.

Do not use `/opt/pzserver` with the bundled service unless you add both `/opt/pzserver` and `/opt/pzserver_Data` to `ReadWritePaths` in `zomboid-panel.service`, then run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` and `sudo systemctl restart zomboid-panel`.

### Docker

The image runs **the panel only** — Project Zomboid itself still has to run somewhere (on the host, in another container, or on a separate machine). The panel reaches it via RCON and via shared filesystem (for PanelBridge).

Pull the prebuilt image:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/zomboid-panel && cd ~/zomboid-panel
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsacha/zomboid-control-panel/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsacha/zomboid-control-panel/main/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```
Then open `http://localhost:3001`.

Before bringing it up for real, edit [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and uncomment the volume mounts that point at your PZ install and `~/Zomboid` folder — the file has two annotated topology examples (PZ on the host vs. PZ on a remote machine). All env vars are documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

Prebuilt images are published to GHCR: `ghcr.io/fpsacha/zomboid-panel:latest` and `:vX.Y.Z`. Prefer to build from source? Comment out `image:` in the compose file and uncomment the `build:` block.

---

## Setup

1. Open the panel and create your admin account.
2. In **Settings**, set your server install path and Zomboid data path.
3. Configure RCON (host, port `27015`, password from your server `.ini`).
4. Optionally install PanelBridge for advanced features.

### PanelBridge (Optional)

PanelBridge is a server-side Lua drop-in that enables features RCON can't reach — teleport, heal, weather control, character export/import, inventory editing, sound triggers.

There is no client-side component. Players don't install anything. The panel copies `PanelBridge.lua` into your server's `Install/media/lua/server/` folder, then you set `DoLuaChecksum=false` in the server INI, restart the PZ server, and enable it in **Settings → PanelBridge**.

For a remote server without a shared filesystem, use the **Remote server via
SFTP** option in the same panel. It syncs the bridge command and result files
through a local cache; it does not expose the server's full filesystem to the
panel.

---

## Remote Access

If you're running the panel on the same machine as your browser, skip this section.

To access the panel from another machine, allow the origin before first launch:

```bash
CORS_ORIGINS=http://YOUR-IP:3001 ./start.sh
```

After login, save it permanently in **Settings → Remote Access** so the env var isn't required next time.

For VPS or public-internet deployment, put the panel behind a reverse proxy (nginx or Caddy) with HTTPS, and set `HTTPS=true` so the panel emits HSTS headers. Don't expose port 3001 directly to the internet.

---

## Security

- JWT authentication on all API routes.
- Rate limiting on login, RCON, and destructive operations.
- RCON parameter sanitization to prevent command injection.
- CORS configurable per deployment (LAN auto-allows private IPs, VPS requires explicit origins).
- Password reset via secure token file or `--reset-password` CLI flag.

---
