    PanelBridge - Server-side mod for Zomboid Control Panel
    Version: 1.7.48

    This mod enables external control panel communication with the PZ server.
    Communication happens via JSON files in the server save folder.

                v1.7.48 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.2.12. No additional bridge
                    protocol changes.

                v1.7.47 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.2.11. No additional bridge
                    protocol changes.

                v1.7.46 Changes:
                - Fix: on a fresh world, Build 42 can report its sandbox
                    countdown as still powered while the live hydro state is
                    off. Startup now restores hydro power only when the same
                    countdown formula the game uses says scheduled power has
                    not yet shut off; intentional instant/expired settings
                    remain off.

                v1.7.45 Changes:
                - Fix: triggerSwarmEvent used to go straight to the
                    fire-and-forget horde APIs (createHordeInAreaTo/
                    createHordeFromTo/CreateSwarm) with no count to read
                    back. Now tries VirtualZombieManager.createRealZombieNow
                    first, same as spawnHordeNearPlayer/BehindPlayer, and
                    reports a real per-zombie spawned count when it does.
                - Fix: removeVehicle reported success purely on the removal
                    call not throwing. Now re-checks the vehicle's presence
                    via getVehiclesList() immediately after removal and only
                    reports success once it's genuinely gone -- confirmed
                    safe via javap -c: BaseVehicle.permanentlyRemove()/
                    removeFromWorld() both synchronously remove from
                    IsoCell's live vehicle Set, no tick-loop delay like the
                    ClimateFloat case had.

                v1.7.44 Changes:
                - Fix: setSnow/startRain/stopRain, the daylight/night/
                    desaturation/view-distance/ambient/temperature/wind/fog/
                    cloud climate floats, the generic setClimateFloat, and
                    resetClimateOverrides now confirm their write actually
                    took effect (getAdminValue/getPrecipitationIsSnow/
                    getPrecipitationIntensity/isRaining/isEnableAdmin, each
                    chosen per-handler against what is actually safe to read
                    immediately -- getFinalValue() is NOT, confirmed via
                    javap -c: it is not refreshed until the next natural
                    game tick) instead of reporting success on invoke() not
                    throwing.

                v1.7.43 Changes:
                - Fix: triggerBlizzard/triggerTropicalStorm/triggerStorm all
                    discarded the real boolean triggerCustomWeatherStage
                    returns, so triggering a second storm while one was
                    already running reported success and did nothing.
                - Fix: generateWeather tried a CLIENT->SERVER-only request
                    packet FIRST (never throws, so the real method was never
                    reached), meaning it very likely did nothing at all on
                    every real call. Now tries the real, verifiable method
                    first whenever the front type supports it.
                - All four now report ok=false with an actionable message
                    when a weather period is already running, instead of a
                    false success.

                v1.7.42 Changes:
                - Fix: stopWeather never cleared a lingering rain
                    admin-override left by startRain/setSnow -- "Stop All
                    Weather" correctly stopped the weather period, but
                    admin-forced rain (a separate ClimateFloat mechanism)
                    kept falling forever. Now also clears it and verifies
                    isRaining() before reporting success.
                - Fix: runEventSequence's `ok` field now reflects whether any
                    step actually failed, not just whether the loop finished.
                - Fix: json.decode dropped \uXXXX escapes into literal
                    "uXXXX" text instead of the real character.
                - This bump exists because the installer (panelBridgeInstaller.js)
                    only redeploys on a VERSION string difference -- the three
                    fixes above landed without one, so a server whose bridge
                    was never separately reinstalled since 1.7.41 does not
                    have them yet even though this VERSION says otherwise.

                v1.7.41 Changes:
                - Fix: the v1.7.12 inbox-desync resync (tryResyncInboxCursor)
                    trusted the panel's declared write position
                    (.queue-state-node.json) unconditionally, including moving
                    lastCommandSeq BACKWARD if that file's value was ever
                    lower than what this process had already processed -- a
                    real hazard demonstrated the same day by four zombie
                    nodemon-wrapped panel processes independently writing
                    that file. The resync is now forward-only, matching the
                    equivalent guard already shipped in panelBridge.js for
                    the opposite (results) direction. Also shortened the
                    stuck-detection window from 20s to 10s, comfortably under
                    Node's own 15s local-transport command timeout, so a real
                    desync always resolves before Node gives up on the
                    caller's request rather than 5s after.

                v1.7.40 Changes:
                - Fixed horde spawning to use the coordinate-aware
                    createRealZombieNow API and report zero-result failures.

                v1.7.39 Changes:
                - getServerInfo now sends isAlive, isInfected and accessLevel
                    per player. Previously absent from the wire entirely (not
                    conditional) -- the panel rendered "alive, uninfected,
                    non-admin" for every player regardless of actual state.
                    Client gates these three fields on this bridge version so
                    an older bridge is never misread as confidently-wrong data.

                v1.7.38 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.1.54. No bridge protocol changes.

                v1.7.36 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.1.49. No bridge protocol changes.

                v1.7.35 Changes:
                - Fixed triggerLightning on Build 42.20 by calling the
                    server-side ThunderStorm event directly. The climate
                    transmit helper can return without an error while no
                    lightning reaches connected clients.

                v1.7.34 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.1.48. No bridge protocol changes.

                v1.7.33 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.1.45. No bridge protocol changes.

                v1.7.32 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.1.44. No bridge protocol changes.

                v1.7.31 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.1.43. No bridge protocol changes.

                v1.7.30 Changes:
                - Bundled with panel v1.1.42. No bridge protocol changes.

                v1.7.29 Changes:
                - A Java method that is unavailable is now retried only a few
                    times before it is remembered as missing. Kahlua reports a
                    missing method as an empty RuntimeException, so the previous
                    text match never recognised it and the engine retraced the
                    same call on every poll. A method that has succeeded once is
                    never disabled, so one broken modded object cannot turn off
                    a working accessor.

                v1.7.28 Changes:
                - Game-time reads only call documented Build 42 clock methods.
                    Optional getter probes emitted a full Kahlua trace when
                    unavailable, even inside pcall.

                v1.7.27 Changes:
                - Healing no longer probes optional body-damage, Stats, or
                    Moodles Java methods. Build 42 logs a full engine trace
                    for each unavailable probe even inside pcall; healing now
                    uses only the documented body-part collection.

                v1.7.26 Changes:
                - Player health actions use the Build 42 body-part collection
                    and native death path without probing absent APIs.

                v1.7.24 Changes:
                - Java methods are now probed by calling them and caching the
                    outcome per class, instead of testing obj.method as a field.
                    A field test reports false for methods that are callable but
                    not exposed as Lua fields, which silently returned zero
                    vehicles (v1.7.23) and let safeGetValue fabricate defaults
                    such as game-time year 1993. A genuinely missing method now
                    costs one engine stack trace per class per session rather
                    than one per tick, and a getter that throws for a broken
                    modded object is never marked unavailable.
                - Live-state caches (vehicles, safehouses, player details) are
                    invalidated after any state-changing command, so a repair,
                    refuel, or battery change is no longer masked for 5 seconds.
                - Queue bookkeeping writes dropped from about five files per
                    command to two: the duplicate inbox cursor write is gone and
                    queue state is persisted once per tick instead of once per
                    result.
                - The legacy commands.json intake is polled every 2s instead of
                    every tick. The panel only writes that file when a numbered
                    queue write fails, so it stays a working fallback.
                - json.encode has a recursion depth limit, and logging no longer
                    rescans the level table or shifts the whole ring buffer on
                    every call.

                v1.7.23 Changes:
                - World Map vehicle polling now skips Java collections that do
                    not expose get as a Lua method. Calling the missing method
                    inside pcall still produces a full PZ server stack trace.

                v1.7.22 Changes:
                - Game clock updates now fail when a Build 42 setter cannot apply
                    the requested value, instead of reporting a false success.

                v1.7.21 Changes:
                - Loaded vehicles reach the panel again. The vehicle list reports
                    its size correctly but does not expose get as a Lua field, so the
                    field-existence guard discarded every vehicle: a live server with
                    21 loaded vehicles returned count 0 and skipped 21. The World Map
                    then showed only vehicles read from vehicles.db, which have no
                    telemetry and no repair or battery controls, even when a player
                    was standing next to the car. Same root cause as the collection
                    guard fixed in v1.7.17. Also restores vehicle lookup by id, so
                    repair, battery, and area removal work again.

                v1.7.20 Changes:
                - Repair and battery controls now use Build 42 vehicle-part APIs.
                - Corrected the runtime version constant so automatic updates
                    recognize this bridge as newer than v1.7.19.

                v1.7.19 Changes:
                - Character imports now preserve the invariant that cumulative XP is
                    at least the threshold for the restored skill level. This prevents
                    invalid states such as level 5 with 0 XP, which render in-game as
                    negative XP progress.

                v1.7.18 Changes:
                - Item validation now accepts valid Build 42 IDs that include numbers
                    or documented punctuation, including Base.556Clip and
                    Base.3030Bullets.
                - Vehicle spawning on Build 42 now uses the panel's supported RCON
                    command path instead of unavailable Lua map APIs.

                v1.7.17 Changes:
        - Fixed character inventory, worn-item, and trait exports on Build 42.
            Java collection methods can be invoked with `:size()` but do not always
            appear as Lua fields, so the previous field-existence guard reported
            every collection as empty before attempting to read it.

        v1.7.15 Changes:
    - setSandboxOption now calls toLua() after setting the value. setValue only
      updates the Java object; mod code reads the global SandboxVars table,
      which stayed stale, so a changed mod option had no visible effect.

    v1.7.14 Changes:
    - teleportPlayer now reports which position-sync APIs actually exist on
      this build. Live results from 42.20.0 showed setNetworkTeleportEnabled
      and setLx are absent, so the server moved the player authoritatively
      but no client was ever told, and the client's own position won.

    v1.7.13 Changes:
    - Merge of two independent fixes that landed under different version
      numbers on diverging branches (this fork's v1.7.12 queue-resync fix
      and an upstream v1.7.10 vehicle-list guard fix; bumped past both to
      keep the auto-updater's strictly-newer check unambiguous):
    - [upstream] Fixed "Object tried to call nil in pcall" spamming the
      console every tick from getVehiclesDetailed / findVehicleById. Both
      called vehicles:get(i) unconditionally, but unlike the .size lookup
      just above it (already guarded with `vehicles.size and
      vehicles:size()`), .get was never guarded — so on servers where the
      vehicle-list object doesn't expose .get, EVERY vehicle lookup threw
      and vehicle data never reached the panel (World Map's vehicle layer
      was stuck at "0 loaded"). Now guarded the same way: `vehicles.get
      and vehicles:get(i) or nil`.
    - Applied the same vehicles:get(i) guard to the area-vehicle-removal
      handler, which had the identical unguarded call site the upstream
      fix above didn't reach.

    v1.7.12 Changes:
    - Fix: the inbox (commands) and outbox (results) queues each require an
      exact sequential file match on both sides, but neither side could ever
      recover if the two independently-persisted sequence counters
      (.queue-state-node.json on the panel side, queue-state-lua.json.txt on
      the mod side) drifted apart — e.g. the panel's queue state file getting
      reset by a container redeploy while this mod's counter kept climbing
      across an uninterrupted game server uptime. A drift left every command
      (including ping) waiting forever/for a very long time on a sequence
      number the other side would never (or not soon) produce, while status
      polling kept reporting healthy since it doesn't go through the
      sequential queue. processQueuedCommands() now detects a sustained
      (20s+) stall waiting on a missing inbox file, peeks at the panel's own
      declared write position in .queue-state-node.json, and resyncs
      lastCommandSeq to match it instead of waiting indefinitely. See the
      matching fix in panelBridge.js for the outbox/results direction.

    v1.7.11 Changes:
    - Perf: flushResults() no longer does a read-modify-write of a legacy
      results.json on every flush. That path only existed for a panel that
      hadn't negotiated protocolVersion=queue-v1, but panel and mod are
      always shipped/auto-updated together in this fork, so it was dead
      weight — doubling the I/O cost of every result flush for zero real
      consumers. onServerStarted() now also clears any stale results.json
      left behind by a pre-retirement mod version.

    v1.7.10 Changes:
    - Merge of two independent 1.7.9 fixes (fork and upstream landed on the
      same version number for different changes; bumped to keep the
      auto-updater's strictly-newer check unambiguous):
    - writeFile() now resolves panel-owned filenames (commands.json,
      inbox/cmd-*.json) to their plain path itself, matching readFile's
      existing logic, instead of relying solely on clearFile's guard.
      Nothing currently calls writeFile with those names, but the previous
      version would have silently written a wrong "commands.json.txt" had
      it ever been called that way.
    - ensureDirectory()'s write-capability fallback now probes a dedicated
      ".write-check" file instead of the real status.json — canWritePath
      actually writes its probe text, so probing the production file could
      briefly hand a reader "PanelBridge probe" instead of valid JSON.

    v1.7.9 Changes:
    - Stopped logging the chat-to-RCON handoff as a failure. sendToServerChat
      returns "useRCON" when neither ChatServer nor an online player is
      available, which tells the panel to deliver the message over RCON — the
      documented primary path. The dispatcher counted that as a failed command
      and logged it at WARN, so every scheduled broadcast sent while the server
      was empty printed "Command failed: sendToServerChat" in the console. The
      sentinel now logs at debug and no longer inflates commandsFailed. The
      result still goes back as unsuccessful, so the RCON fallback is unchanged.

    v1.7.8 Changes:
    - CRITICAL: Build 42 buildid 24449161 (2026-07-29) restricted getFileWriter
      to an extension whitelist. Writing a .json file now returns nil, so every
      Lua-owned bridge file silently failed and the heartbeat, queue state and
      command results stopped reaching the panel. getFileReader is unaffected.
      Verified live with a write probe: .txt is accepted, while .json, .init and
      extension-less names are rejected; nested paths themselves are still fine.
      Every file the mod writes now carries a .txt suffix, e.g.
      panelbridge/<server>/status.json.txt. Reads prefer the suffixed file and
      fall back to the legacy name, and panel-owned files (commands.json and
      inbox/cmd-*.json) keep their plain names because the panel writes them.
      Directory creation is now solely the panel's responsibility.

    v1.7.6 / v1.7.7 Changes:
    - Superseded by v1.7.8. These builds worked around the same regression by
      writing files flat in <cachedir>/Lua/, which was the wrong diagnosis: the
      restriction is on the file extension, not on directory separators.

    v1.7.5 Changes:
    - CRITICAL: Reverted the v1.7.4 .init shortcut. Skipping the sentinel write
      when the file already existed left the bridge directory uninitialized for
      the running session, so Build 42 refused every subsequent write into it
      ("Could not write to panelbridge/<server>/status.json" and friends) and
      the heartbeat never reached the panel. The sentinel is written on every
      startup again; the existing-file check is now only a non-fatal fallback.

        v1.7.4 Changes:
        - Fixed B42 startup when the PanelBridge .init sentinel already exists.
            Reusing the existing sentinel avoids a getFileWriter refusal that
            prevented the heartbeat event from being initialized.

        v1.7.3 Changes:
    - CRITICAL: Fixed VERSION constant regression. It had been hand-edited back
      to "1.2.2" (and mod.info modversion along with it) despite the file
      already containing features documented through v1.7.2 below. Since the
      panel's auto-updater only overwrites the on-server file when its
      embedded version is STRICTLY NEWER than what's installed, a server
      already running real 1.7.x content was being permanently skipped by
      future updates — the exact class of bug the panel binary itself hit
      (v1.0.66 self-reporting v1.0.65). VERSION and mod.info modversion must
      always be bumped together from now on.
    - Fixed JSON decoder: null values inside arrays no longer silently vanish
      and shift later elements' indices (e.g. [1,null,2] used to decode as
      {1,2}). Nulls now decode to a `json.null` sentinel so array length and
      positions are preserved; json.encode serializes the sentinel back to
      `null`. Object keys with a null value are unaffected (still become an
      absent key, which was already the intended/documented behaviour).
    - Fixed processedIds cleanup: the "drop oldest half" trim iterated
      `pairs()`, whose order is unspecified in Lua — so it was really
      dropping an ARBITRARY half, not the oldest. Now tracks insertion order
      explicitly (a small FIFO of ids) so the true oldest half is dropped.
    - Added short TTL caching (5s) for the read-only catalog/enumeration
      handlers that are either expensive to scan (getItemCatalog,
      getVehicleCatalog, getAllSandboxOptions) or polled on a fixed schedule
      by the panel (getVehiclesDetailed, getSafehouses, getAllPlayerDetails).
      A panel view left open on the Items/Vehicles/Sandbox page no longer
      re-triggers a full synchronous game-thread scan on every poll.

    v1.2.2 Changes:
    - Fixed JSON encoder: empty Lua tables now serialize as [] (array) instead of {} (object).
      The previous behaviour crashed panel consumers that did .map/.filter on
      collection fields like safehouses/factions/vehicles when the server was empty.
    - Hardened JSON decoder: malformed objects with non-string keys are skipped
      instead of crashing the command-poll loop.

    v1.2.1 Changes:
    - Synced runtime VERSION constant with mod.info (was 1.1.1)
    - No behavioural changes; bump triggers panel auto-update on existing servers

    v1.7.2 Changes:
    - Fixed teleportPlayer: use NetworkTeleport.teleport() for proper network-synced teleport
    - setPosition() only moves server-side coords; NetworkTeleport handles client sync

    v1.7.1 Changes:
    - Item catalog now excludes vehicle entries (vehicles served separately)
    - Removed debug logging from catalog handler registration

    v1.7.0 Changes:
    - Added getAllSandboxOptions handler: enumerates ALL sandbox options (vanilla + mod-registered)
      with metadata (type, min/max, default, enum values), grouped by mod/table name

    v1.6.0 Changes:
    - Added vehicleSetFuel and vehicleSetBattery handlers for remote vehicle management
    - Added safehouse player list to getSafehouses response
    - Added getTimeSpeed / setTimeSpeed handlers for time multiplier control
    - Added triggerHelicopterEvent handler
    - Fixed processedIds cleanup: sliding window (drop oldest half) instead of full clear
    - Removed dead sendServerMessage handler (superseded by sendToServerChat)
    - Removed addLamppost/removeLamppost from backend whitelist (no Lua implementation)

    v1.5.0 Changes:
    - Fixed teleportPlayer for B42: use NetworkTeleport.teleport() for proper network sync
    - Added B41 fallback chain: setPosition → setX/Y/Z + setNetworkTeleportEnabled
    - Added airdrop system handler

    v1.4.3 Changes:
    - CRITICAL: Fixed JSON object parser infinite loop on malformed input (while true → bounded)
    - Added pcall protection to getWeather handler for cross-version safety
    - Added pcall protection to getServerInfo GameTime access
    - Added per-field pcall to setGameTime to prevent partial failure cascades
    - Added pcall to teleportPlayer for proper error reporting
    - Added safe individual access to getSandboxOptions for B42 compatibility
    - Clamped giveItem count to 1-100 per call to prevent server freeze
    - Fixed indentation in shutOffUtilities Step 8

    v1.4.2 Changes:
    - Fixed race condition in command processing (infinite command loops)
    - Improved type declaration safety for all Climate handlers (numeric parsing)
    - Fixed ambiguous inputs in generic climate float handler
    - Cleanup of unused reference code

    v1.4.1 Changes:
    - Increased status update frequency from 5s to 3s for faster panel detection

    v1.4.0 Changes:
    - Added comprehensive debug logging system with toggleable debug mode
    - Added API version detection (B41 vs B42)
    - Added method availability checking before calling API methods
    - Added detailed error context in all handlers
    - Added getDebugLog handler to retrieve recent log entries
    - Added setDebugMode handler to enable/disable verbose logging
    - Added checkAPI handler to test API method availability
    - Added getAvailableHandlers to list all supported commands
    - Improved error messages with stack traces when available
    - Added performance timing to command execution
    - Added command statistics tracking

    v1.3.1 Changes:
    - Fixed B42 compatibility for getPlayerTraits (traits now accessed via SurvivorDesc)
    - Improved trait extraction to handle both B41 and B42 API differences

    v1.3.0 Changes:
    - Added comprehensive player export/import system
    - exportPlayerData: Full character data including inventory, perks, traits, recipes
    - importPlayerData: Restore perks, stats, and recipes (inventory/traits require manual restore)
    - Added chat system handlers via ChatServer API
    - sendToServerChat: Server messages to all players (with alert option)
    - sendToAdminChat: Messages visible only to admins
    - sendToGeneralChat: General chat with custom author name
    - getChatInfo: Query available chat types and server status

    v1.2.0 Changes:
    - Added sound/noise control for zombie attraction
    - playWorldSound: Create sound at coordinates
    - playSoundNearPlayer: Create sound at player location
    - triggerGunshot: High-radius gunshot sound
    - triggerAlarmSound: Medium-radius alarm sound
    - createNoise: Customizable noise creation

    v1.1.0 Changes:
    - Added comprehensive climate controls (wind, temp, fog, clouds, precipitation)
    - Added rain/lightning control
    - Added ClimateFloat admin control system
    - Added time/date control
    - Added sandbox options querying
    - Added enhanced player info
    - Fixed snow to auto-enable rain

-- discard real data (v1.7.17 collections, v1.7.21/v1.7.23 vehicles) or
-- substitute fabricated defaults. The only reliable test is to call it.
--
-- Calling a genuinely missing method makes the engine print a stack trace
-- even inside pcall, so the outcome is cached per class+method and the call
-- is never retried. A method that exists but throws (a broken modded
-- vehicle's getter) is NOT marked unavailable, so one bad object cannot
-- disable a working accessor server-wide.

    -- marked unavailable, and every OTHER object sharing it is then refused

-- The `verified` FIELD IN THE RESPONSE IS A STRING, ALWAYS PRESENT WHEN
-- ok=true -- never a boolean, never omitted. This is a deliberate ruling,
-- not a style choice: the bridge mod lives on the user's Project Zomboid
-- server and can be OLDER than the panel (an operator updates the panel and

-- administers). With an omitted-key-means-unverified convention, an OLD

-- the operator. With the key always present, a MISSING key means exactly
-- one thing: an old bridge. See also: an absent value carrying two
-- different meanings is the exact shape of a separate, real bug this floor
-- hit the same night (empty stdout meaning both "scan failed" and "nothing
-- running", indistinguishable, that cost an operator a working button) --
-- this rule exists so `verified` does not become a second instance of it.
--
--   verified (the ARGUMENT to this function) == true  -> the write is
--       confirmed to have taken effect. Response gets verified="confirmed".
--   verified == false -> a real read-back disagrees with what was
--       requested. This handler must NOT report ok=true -- a false success
--       is silent and nobody ever learns otherwise; a false failure here is
--       loud and self-correcting (the operator just retries). Returns
--       ok=false with failMessage; there is no "succeeded but verified is
--       false" state for a client to special-case.
--   verified == nil -> no read-back was possible (the underlying game API
--       is void, or the requested change was too small to distinguish from
--       a no-op). This is NOT a failure -- the call was made, the result
--       cannot be confirmed. Response gets verified="unverifiable". Must
--       not be conflated with verified == false (see the a-and-b-or-c idiom
--       bug this file used to have: collapsing "confirmed wrong" and
--       "can't tell" into one value is exactly the bug that made an earlier
--       fix's gate unreachable).

-- invoke()'s real result, and verify-gate on it via PanelBridge.verifiedResult
-- (same convention as stopWeather) instead of trusting invoke()'s pcall-only
-- signal. The transmitTrigger* fallback (legacy/B41, void return -- no

--      wrong one. Its own bytecode: no-ops if GameClient.client is true,
--      otherwise stops weatherPeriod + thunderstorm and, if
--      GameServer.server is true, ALSO transmits a ServerOnly climate
--      packet to sync connected clients. And the in-game "Stop current
--      weather" debug button's own server-side packet handler
--      (serverReceiveClientChangeWeather, reached via transmitStopWeather's
--      ClientOnly request) calls this EXACT SAME method -- there is no
--      hidden extra step on the working path. transmitStopWeather itself is
--      a CLIENT->SERVER request packet (ClimateNetAuth.ClientOnly) -- the
--      wrong one to call FROM the server, not the missing piece.
--   2. The REAL gap: precipitationIntensity is a ClimateFloat with its own
--      admin-override mechanism (used by handlers.startRain /
--      handlers.setSnow, via setAdminValue+setEnableAdmin). ClimateFloat's
--      calculate() (decompiled) pins finalValue = adminValue UNCONDITIONALLY
--      whenever isAdminOverride is true, completely bypassing weatherPeriod
--      -- and isRaining() is defined as getPrecipitationIntensity() > 0 AND
--      NOT snow. stopWeatherAndThunder never touches this override; only
--      transmitServerStopRain (what handlers.stopRain already calls) does.
--      So once rain had EVER been admin-forced via the panel, "Stop All
--      Weather" stopped the weather PERIOD but the admin-pinned rain kept
--      falling forever -- exactly the reported symptom. The panel's "Stop
--      All Weather" button (Events.tsx) only ever called this handler, not
--      the separate "Reset Climate" button (handlers.resetClimateOverrides)
--      that WOULD have cleared it -- an easy thing for an operator to not
--      think to also press, and a much bigger hammer (resets every climate
--      float, not just rain) than "stop weather" should require anyway.

-- the real, boolean-returning, context-checked B42 method -- was NEVER
-- reached, for any frontType, ever. And transmitGenerateWeather is a

        -- engineDoStarting exists on BaseVehicle in the real B42 jar, so it is the
        -- one that actually fires, every time. startEngine and setEngineRunning
        -- are both ABSENT from BaseVehicle -- despite the "B42/B41: setEngineRunning"
        -- label reading like a confirmed method name, it is not one; that tier
        -- (and the startEngine tier before it) never executes. Nothing here is
        -- user-visibly broken -- tier 3 always lands and vehicles start -- but two
        -- of the three "approaches" are dead code.
        --
        -- BaseVehicle also declares tryStartEngine (two overloads) and a real
        -- isEngineRunning getter, and this handler uses NEITHER. That is a
        -- deliberate choice, not an oversight: tryStartEngine reads like it may
        -- respect preconditions (key, fuel, battery) and refuse to start if they
        -- are unmet, where engineDoStarting reads like it drives the starting
        -- sequence directly regardless. Swapping to tryStartEngine could silently
        -- turn this working admin command into one that refuses on an unfueled
        -- vehicle, and nothing in this repo's test suite can tell us that -- it
        -- needs a live server to observe. Choosing between them is a product
        -- decision, not a cleanup, so it is left alone here.
        --
        -- All three tiers stay in place below, dead or not: removing the dead
        -- ones without this note would either get something new wired to a dead
        -- path, or get the live one deleted by a future reader thinking it's the
