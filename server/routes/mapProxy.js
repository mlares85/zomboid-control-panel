// ─── B42 map version resolution ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// b42map.com has migrated to pzmap.org. The old map.projectzomboid.com host
// now redirects there, adding another failure point for direct browser loads.
//
// pzmap.org split into two hosts: the site root and its build-list API stayed
// at pzmap.org, but tiles and every per-build descriptor under a version
// directory (map_info.json, layer0.dzi, base_top/layer0.dzi, and the tiles
// themselves) moved to tiles.pzmap.org AND dropped the /maps path segment:
//   old (404s now): https://pzmap.org/maps/<version>/base/layer<floor>_files/<level>/<tile>
//   new:            https://tiles.pzmap.org/<version>/base/layer<floor>_files/<level>/<tile>
//
// build_list.json (what this file used to fetch for the build list) is DEAD,
// not just blocked -- it's a genuine 404 on both hosts. pzmap.org's own
// current bundle (read directly out of its shipped JS) fetches
// GET pzmap.org/api/builds/default (the build pzmap.org itself is showing
// right now) and GET pzmap.org/api/builds (the full list, oldest-first --
// NOT newest-first, unlike the old build_list.json's assumed ordering) as a
// fallback when no entry is flagged default. See fetchBuildDefault() /
// fetchBuildList() below.
//
// Separately: every JSON/XML/HTML descriptor path this file needs on EITHER
// host (pzmap.org/api/builds*, tiles.pzmap.org/<dir>/base/layer0.dzi,
// .../map_info.json, .../base_top/layer0.dzi) is behind a Cloudflare
// bot-management challenge that blocks Node's own TLS stack outright --
// confirmed identically for both `fetch` and the `https` module, so this is
// not a fetch-vs-https question, it's every HTTP client built on Node's TLS
// stack. curl gets through this challenge far more reliably than either --
// confirmed independently by two of us, across every path on both hosts,
// many times over. Raw tile BYTES (.../layer<floor>_files/<level>/<tile>.jpg,
// what serveTile() below fetches) are NOT behind this rule for any client
// tested, including plain Node fetch -- that's why tile serving already
// works today even though discovery doesn't; don't route serveTile()'s
// per-tile hot path through curl, there's no need and spawning a process
// per tile would be a real perf regression.
//
// What curl's success does NOT depend on, despite an earlier theory here:
// a specific User-Agent string. We measured curl passing with a spoofed
// full browser UA, and separately passing with this file's own honest
// identifying UA below -- and, hours apart, saw one of those SAME requests
// briefly 403 for no header-shaped reason at all. Whatever gates these
// paths is probabilistic and/or IP- or time-scored, not a deterministic
// per-request rule we can satisfy by getting a header right. So:
// getB42Map() below treats every curl call as expected to occasionally (or
// even permanently, if the heuristic tightens) fail -- caches a good
// result, never caches a failure as if it were an answer, and always keeps
// the hardcoded fallback as a real last resort. Do not build logic here
// that assumes a successful resolve today predicts one tomorrow.

// because SOME plausible User-Agent is still better than none for a client
// that might get more scrutiny with no header at all -- see the header
// comment above for why this string is NOT load-bearing the way an earlier
// version of this comment claimed. Keep it identifying; do not swap in a
// browser-spoofing string on the theory that it's required, that theory
