// GH#109: a requested DZI tile level can be within the map's theoretical
// maxLevel yet still have no tile actually rendered upstream for most of
// the map -- maxLevel is the depth a FULL Deep Zoom pyramid would need for
// the image's dimensions, computed purely from width/height, not evidence
// the tile host rendered that deep (level 21 at 1024px tiles is ~563,000
// tiles for one floor). Zooming past the real coverage boundary made the
// exact-level tile 404, and WorldMap's drawMap simply skipped drawing
// anything for that rect -- terrain turned solid black over the dark
// canvas background while player/vehicle markers (drawn as separate vector
// passes, unaffected by tile state) kept rendering fine. Pulled out of
// WorldMap.tsx as a pure function so the fallback-selection math can be
// unit tested without mounting the canvas.

// the missing (level, col, row) tile -- the caller draws that rectangle
// stretched over the destination rect instead of leaving it untouched.
// `request` is called for every candidate level even when nothing is
// cached there yet, so a coarser tile nobody has otherwise asked for still
// gets loaded and is available as a fallback on a later redraw -- without
// this, a user who zooms straight past several levels never gets a
// fallback at all, since nothing else asks for non-current-level tiles.
